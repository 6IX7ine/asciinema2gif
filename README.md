## asciinema2gif

Generate an animated GIF from [asciinema terminal recordings].

### Motivation

The `asciinema` tool is a wonderful way to record and share terminal sessions.  
Unfortunately, it's not [currently possible] to embed the output in places like  
README files on GitHub repos. This tool provides a solution for that.

### Usage

Simply pass in the corresponding API url for the recording, e.g.

```bash
$ ./asciinema2gif https://asciinema.org/api/asciicasts/8332
```

An `asciicast.gif` file will then be generated for you to embed and share.

The API url supports a few customisable parameters you might want to use:

* `?size=`: `small`, `medium`, `big`
* `?theme=`: `tango`, `solarized-dark`, `solarized-light`

### Requirements
